# Task Recursion

Task 1: Set the values of M and N. Write a programme that outputs all natural numbers in the interval from M to N. Use recursion, do not use loops.

Task 2: Write a programme for calculating the Ackerman function using recursion. Two non-negative numbers m and n are given.

Task 3: Define an arbitrary array. Output its elements starting from the end. Use recursion, do not use loops.
